# Viet Nam Air Quality

This project focuses on visualizing air quality at specific locations in Vietnam for the year 2021. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using Tableau. Additionally, an ARIMA model was utilized to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Hanoi for July 2023

We used 2 datasets in this project:

- Air Quality in Vietnam 2021 for EDA from [opendevelopmentmekong.net](https://data.vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/dataset/dataset-on-air-quality-in-vietnam-in-2021)
- Air Quality in Hanoi jan 2020-july 2023 : [aqicn.org](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/)
